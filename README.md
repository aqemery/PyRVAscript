# PyRVAscript

We are going to talk about why pyscript is a big deal, and how to get started!


## UI technologies overview

First, Let do a quick overview of web technologies.

### [HTML (HyperText Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* 29 years old
* Download from a web server
* HTML elements like `<div>` `<p>`
* Embedded scripting languages (JavaScript)
* HTML5 introduced in 2014 is used for audio, video, and the canvas element
* [DOM (Document Object Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)
* Email

## [CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
* 17 years old
* Layout, color, font
* Animations

## [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* 26 years old
* > As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior”
* > Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting.
* Third-party JavaScript library examples: jQuery, React, Angular, vue

## [V8 engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine))
* 13 years old
* Embedded due to node.js
* [JS is fast!?](https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/)
* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)
* [npm (node package manager)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software))
* [Webpack (module bundler)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack)

## [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript)
* 9 years old
* JavaScript superset
* static typing and other language extensions
* Transpiles to JavaScript

## Python and the web

* python is used for many [web frameworks](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks)
* [server side rendering via templates](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/templates.html) - [fast api example](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/templates/)
* [iPython](https://ipython.org) - [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) - [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
* Pyodide is a port of CPython to [WebAssembly WASM](https://webassembly.org)




Background

PyScript is in alpha

PyScript - programming for the 99%

One of the goals of PyScript is to make the Web a friendly place for anyone wanting to learn to code, including kids. The framework achieves that goal by not requiring any installation or configuration process beyond your existing text editor and a browser. A side effect is that PyScript simplifies sharing your work with others.

PyScript is a Pythonic alternative to Scratch, JSFiddle, and other "easy to use" programming frameworks, with the goal of making the web a friendly, hackable place where anyone can author interesting and interactive applications.


PyScript is a meta project that aims to combine multiple open technologies into a framework that allows users to create sophisticated browser applications with Python. It integrates seamlessly with the way the DOM works in the browser and allows users to add Python logic in a way that feels natural both to web and Python developers.



Server side vs client side rendering
Manipulating the DOM
HTML
CSS

Need for web-server


Why is pyscript exciting
How it works

Pyodide
WASM

Alpha so it’s a bit slow

It’s kinda like Jupiter 

How imports work
What about custom imports
Built in visual components

Interacting with javascript
Using pyscript in an existing js app
