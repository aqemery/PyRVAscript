# PyRVAscript

We are going to talk about why pyscript is a big deal, and how to get started!

First, Let do an [intro](https://github.com/aqemery/PyRVAscript/blob/main/Intro.md) to set the stage.


# PyScript - programming for the 99%

Introduced at pycon 2022, PyScript utilized [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) to run python in the browser.

> Please be advised that PyScript is very alpha and under heavy development. There are many known issues, from usability to loading times, and you should expect things to change often. We encourage people to play and explore with PyScript, but at this time we do not recommend using it for production.


> One of the goals of PyScript is to make the Web a friendly place for anyone wanting to learn to code, including kids. The framework achieves that goal by not requiring any installation or configuration process beyond your existing text editor and a browser. A side effect is that PyScript simplifies sharing your work with others.

> PyScript is a Pythonic alternative to Scratch, JSFiddle, and other "easy to use" programming frameworks, with the goal of making the web a friendly, hackable place where anyone can author interesting and interactive applications.

> PyScript is a meta project that aims to combine multiple open technologies into a framework that allows users to create sophisticated browser applications with Python. It integrates seamlessly with the way the DOM works in the browser and allows users to add Python logic in a way that feels natural both to web and Python developers.

PyScript is a meta project that aims to combine multiple open technologies into a framework that allows users to create sophisticated browser applications with Python. It integrates seamlessly with the way the DOM works in the browser and allows users to add Python logic in a way that feels natural both to web and Python developers.

CSS

Need for web-server


Why is pyscript exciting
How it works

Pyodide
WASM

Alpha so it’s a bit slow

It’s kinda like Jupiter 

How imports work
What about custom imports
Built in visual components
