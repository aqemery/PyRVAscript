# PyRVAscript

We are going to talk about why pyscript is a big deal, and how to get started!

First, Let do an [intro](https://github.com/aqemery/PyRVAscript/blob/main/Intro.md) to set the stage.

PyScript is in alpha

PyScript - programming for the 99%

One of the goals of PyScript is to make the Web a friendly place for anyone wanting to learn to code, including kids. The framework achieves that goal by not requiring any installation or configuration process beyond your existing text editor and a browser. A side effect is that PyScript simplifies sharing your work with others.

PyScript is a Pythonic alternative to Scratch, JSFiddle, and other "easy to use" programming frameworks, with the goal of making the web a friendly, hackable place where anyone can author interesting and interactive applications.


PyScript is a meta project that aims to combine multiple open technologies into a framework that allows users to create sophisticated browser applications with Python. It integrates seamlessly with the way the DOM works in the browser and allows users to add Python logic in a way that feels natural both to web and Python developers.
